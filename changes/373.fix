Stabilize multi-container sessions further.
 - Include predicate check results in `kernels.status_data` for better user-side diagnosis
 - Fix further race condition in the session-level creation routines, just like the kernel-level creation routines in #374.
 - Remove the no longer used `agents.clusterized` column as it is no longer included in agent heartbeats after k8s branch refactoring.
